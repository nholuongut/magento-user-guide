When automatic redirects are enabled and you save a category, all product and category rewrites are generated in real time and stored in rewrite tables by default. This could result in significant performance issues for categories with many assigned products. The solution is to change this default and skip the generation of category/products URL rewrites of products for category save. In this case, product rewrites are generated only for the canonical product URL. See [Automatic Product Redirects]({% link marketing/url-redirect-product-automatic.md -%}) for more information.
