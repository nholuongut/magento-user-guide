Unassigning a source clears all quantity data. Reassigning a source can potentially cause issues with salable quantities, reservations, and pending orders. We recommend processing all orders prior to unassigning sources, or other source changes. You can also use new commands to detect and update reservations. See DevDocs [Inventory CLI reference]({{ site.devdocs_url }}/guides/v{{ site.version }}/inventory/inventory-cli-reference.html).
