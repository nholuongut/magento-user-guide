Price rules are automatically processed with other system rules. Processing frequency depends on your installation's [cron configuration]({{ site.devdocs_url }}/guides/v{{ site.version }}/config-guide/cli/config-cli-subcommands-cron.html). When you create a new price rule, allow enough time for it to get into the system. Then, test the rule to make sure that it works correctly.
