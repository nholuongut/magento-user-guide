* Your products may break policies on [Prohibited Content][1].
* Ensure your products prices and availability (in or out of stock) match between your online storefront and GMC account. The quantity can differ and does not affect approval.

* Consider not selling products that require personalization or customization during checkout. See Google's [Troubleshooter: Personalized goods][3].
* Determine if your products require a GTIN or Unique Product Identifier using Google's [decision form][4].
* Images may not display correctly due to a number of possible issues including lag in updating files, caching of old images after you provide new images, images use unsupported formats (JPG, PNG, GIF are supported), image URLs have changed or are incorrect, redirection issues, file size issues, and a few other possibilities. See Google's [Fix images that aren't displaying][5].
