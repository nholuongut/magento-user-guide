**Payment Services Directive Requirements:** <br/>
Beginning September 14, 2019, European banks will decline payments which do not meet [PSD2]({% link stores/compliance-payment-services-directive.md %}) requirements. No action is needed for PayPal Express Checkout to comply with [PSD2]({% link stores/compliance-payment-services-directive.md %}) because all requirements are handled by PayPal.
