This topic describes standard search functionality that might differ from [Live Search]({% link live-search/overview.md %}).

The Search Results list includes all products that match the search criteria entered in the Quick Search box or the Advanced Search form. Every product list in the catalog has essentially the same controls. The only difference is that one is the result of a search query, and the other difference is the result of [navigation]({% link catalog/navigation.md %}).

The results can be formatted as either a grid or list and sorted by a selection of attributes. [Pagination]({% link catalog/navigation-pagination.md %}) controls appear if there are more products than fit on the page. Use these controls to move from one page to the next. The number of records per page is determined by the Catalog Frontend configuration. For more information, see [Product Listings]({% link catalog/navigation-product-listings.md %}).
