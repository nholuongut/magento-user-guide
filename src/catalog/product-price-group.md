title: Group Price
---

A discounted price on any product can be extended to members of a specific customer group, provided they shop while logged in to their accounts. The discounted price appears on the product page with the regular price noted below, and replaces the regular price in the shopping cart.

Customer group prices are a component of tier pricing and are set up in a similar way. The only difference is that customer group prices have a quantity of 1.
