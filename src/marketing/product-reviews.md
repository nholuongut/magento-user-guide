title: Product Reviews
---

Product reviews help to build a sense of community, and are considered more credible than any advertising money can buy. In fact, some search engines give sites with product reviews a higher ranking than those without. For those who find your site by searching for a specific product, a product review is essentially the landing page of your store. Product reviews help people find your store, keep them engaged, and often lead to sales.

Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source offer multiple product review options:

- [Commerce Product Reviews]({% link marketing/magento-product-reviews.md %})
- [Yotpo Product Reviews]({% link marketing/yotpo-reviews-intro.md %})
