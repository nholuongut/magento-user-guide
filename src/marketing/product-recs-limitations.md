As we continue to evolve this technology and ensure you are successful in implementing Product Recommendations, it is critical that we are clear about any limitations to this technology. The following lists features that are not supported at this time:

1. Bundled and grouped products - While Product Recommendations now support showing Bundled and Grouped products, there is a limitation in how their pricing is calculated. Currently, pricing is received as zero or null, which causes it to be hidden in the default storefront template for recommendations.

1. Category permissions - Product Recommendations do not filter based on if customers or segments only have visibility to certain categories or products. The result is that shoppers might see recommendations for products they do not have access to.
