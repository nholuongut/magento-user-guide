When invitations are enabled, customers can send and view [invitations]({% link customers/account-dashboard-my-invitations.md %}) from the dashboard of their customer accounts. The invitation email includes a link to your storeâ€™s [Customer Login]({% link customers/customer-account.md %}) page.

## Customer Invitation Workflow

1. **Customer prepares invitations**: From the account dashboard, the customer prepares the list of recipients and completes the invitation. A custom message can be included, depending on the configuration.
1. **Customer sends invitations**: When ready, the customer clicks the _Send Invitations_ button.
1. **System manages transmission**: The system sends invitations in batches, according to the number set in the configuration.
1. **Customer monitors response**: The customer monitors the status of each invitation from the account dashboard, as `Sent`, `Accepted`, or `Canceled`.

1. In the upper-right corner, click **Add Invitations**.
