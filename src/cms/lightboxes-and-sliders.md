title: Adding a Lightbox or Slider
---

- It is easy to add a [slider]({% link cms/page-builder-media-slider.md %}) to your store with [Page Builder]({% link cms/page-builder.md %}). The slider can be set to play automatically, or controlled manually with navigation buttons.

   There is also a wide assortment of jQuery-based image lightboxes available on [Commerce Marketplace][1], and some are free.

- You can also download an extension from Commerce Marketplace. For additional help, see the documentation provided by the extension developer.
